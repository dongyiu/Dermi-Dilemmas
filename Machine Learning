Data Collection and Preprocessing: 
#TBC 

Represent data relationship: 
# Do you think it's needed? 

Feature Engineering: 
#Consider creating additional features that might enhance model performance.

Splitting the Data: 
#Split the data into training and testing sets.

Selecting a Model: 
TBC

Model Training:
#Train the selected model using the training data. 

Model Evaluation:
#Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set, using appropriate metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

Hyperparameter Tuning:
#Optimize the model's hyperparameters for better performance.

---> Deploy ----> 

Deployment:
#Deploy the model using a web framework or cloud services. Flask, Django, or FastAPI can be used for creating a simple API
#Can deploy the model on cloud platforms like Google Cloud.

---> Showcase --->

Website Integration:
#Integrate the deployed model into the website by making API calls.
#Use front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user interface for interacting with the model
